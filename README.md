Data analysis for the functional taxonomy of tumor suppressors

## Overview
We used a multiplexed autochthonous mouse model of oncogenic Kras-driven human lung adenocarcinoma to quantify the impact of forty-eight known and putative tumor suppressor genes on diverse aspects of carcinogenesis at an unprecedented scale and resolution. We discover many previously understudied functional tumor suppressors that constrain multiple aspects of carcinogenesis in vivo. Inactivation of some genes substantially elevates tumor growth rate, while the inactivation of others increases the probability of tumor initiation and/or the emergence of exceptionally large tumors. While some known and novel functional tumor suppressor genes exert particularly strong effects during specific phases of tumorigenesis, others impact multiple facets of tumor development. These direct and causal analyses uncover an unexpectedly complex functional landscape of tumor suppression.
